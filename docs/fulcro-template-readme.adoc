== The Project

WARNING: This template is in progress. The README is out of date, and at any given time it might not even be working. This
is not ready for general consumption yet.

NOTE: The YouTube videos and Developer's Guide are slightly out of date with respect to this template.  This template
now uses Pathom for server-side mutation and query handling.  See `app/server_components/pathom_wrappers.clj` and
`app/model/user.clj` for the macro definitions and examples of how to define
query resolution and mutations on the server-side. The `defmutation` AND `defresolver` in this project look like
`defn` instead of Fulcro's.

IMPORTANT: This is a Tools Deps Project.  The `project.clj` file is *ONLY* for uberjar generation.  If you're
opening this project in IntelliJ, open `deps.edn`, NOT `project.clj`.

Dependency Aliases:

You will want to enable the `:dev` dependency while developing this project.  In IntelliJ this is in the
"Clojure Deps" border tab window under "Aliases".

The main project source is in `src/main`.

== Setting Up

The shadow-cljs compiler uses all cljsjs and NPM js dependencies through
NPM. If you use a library that is in cljsjs you will also have to add
it to your `package.json`.

You also cannot compile this project until you install the ones it
depends on already:

```
$ npm install
```

or if you prefer `yarn`:

```
$ yarn install
```

Adding NPM Javascript libraries is as simple as adding them to your
`package.json` file and requiring them! See the
[the Shadow-cljs User's Guide](https://shadow-cljs.github.io/docs/UsersGuide.html#_javascript)
for more information.

== Development Mode

Shadow-cljs handles the client-side development build. The file
`src/main/app/client.cljs` contains the code to start and refresh
the client for hot code reload.

In general it is easiest just to run the compiler in server mode:

```
$ npx shadow-cljs server
INFO: XNIO version 3.3.8.Final
Nov 10, 2018 8:08:23 PM org.xnio.nio.NioXnio <clinit>
INFO: XNIO NIO Implementation Version 3.3.8.Final
shadow-cljs - HTTP server for :test available at http://localhost:8022
shadow-cljs - HTTP server for :workspaces available at http://localhost:8023
shadow-cljs - server version: 2.7.2
shadow-cljs - server running at http://localhost:9630
shadow-cljs - socket REPL running on port 51936
shadow-cljs - nREPL server started on port 9000
...
```

then *navigate to the server URL* (shown in this example as http://localhost:9630) and
use the *Builds* menu to enable/disable whichever builds you want watched/running.

Shadow-cljs will also start a web server for any builds that configure one. This
template configures one for workspaces, and one for tests:

- NOT YET PORTED: Workspaces: [http://localhost:8023/workspaces](http://localhost:8023/workspaces)
- Tests: [http://localhost:8022](http://localhost:8022)

See the server section below for working on the full-stack app itself.

=== Client REPL

The shadow-cljs compiler starts an nREPL. It is configured to start on
port 9000 (in `shadow-cljs.edn`).

In IntelliJ: add a *remote* Clojure REPL configuration with
host `localhost` and port `9000`.

then something like:

```
(shadow/nrepl-select :main)
```

will connect you to the REPL for a specific build (NOTE: Make sure you have
a browser running the result, or your REPL won't have anything to talk to!)

If you're using CIDER
see [the Shadow-cljs User's Guide](https://shadow-cljs.github.io/docs/UsersGuide.html#_cider)
and the comments in `deps.edn` for more information.

=== The API Server

In order to work with your main application you'll want to
start your own server that can also serve your application's API.

Start a LOCAL clj nREPL in IntelliJ (using IntelliJ's classpath with
the `dev` alias selected in the Clojure Deps tab), or from the command line:

```bash
$ clj -A:dev -J-Dtrace -J-Dghostwheel.enabled=true
user=> (start)
user=> (stop)
...
user=> (restart) ; stop, reload server code, and go again
user=> (tools-ns/refresh) ; retry code reload if hot server reload fails
```

The `-J-Dtrace` adds a JVM argument that will enable performance tracing for Fulcro Inspect's network tab so you can
see how your resolvers and mutations are performing.

The `-J-Dghostwheel.enabled=true` turns on ghostwheel instrumentation of ghostwheel spec'd functions, which is a wrapper
of Clojure spec that makes instrumentation and production-time elision (for performance and size) much easier.

The URL to work on your application is then
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Hot code reload, preloads, and such are all coded into the javascript.

IMPORTANT: The server comes pre-secured with CSRF protection. If you have
trouble getting the client to talk to the server make sure you've read
and understood the security section of the http://book.fulcrologic.com[Developer's Guide].

=== Preloads

There is a preload file that is used on the development build of the
application `app.development-preload`. You can add code here that
you want to execute before the application initializes in development
mode.

=== Fulcro Inspect

Fulcro inspect will preload on the development build of the main
application and workspaces.  You must install the plugin in Chrome from the
Chrome store (free) to access it.  It will add a Fulcro Inspect tab to the
developer tools pane.

== Tests

Tests are in `src/test`. Any test namespace ending in `-test` will be auto-detected.

```
src/test
└── app
    └── sample_test.cljc          spec runnable by client and server.
```

You can write plain `deftest` in here, and it is preconfigured to support the helper macros in `fulcro-spec` as well.

=== Running tests:


==== Clojure Tests

Typically you'll just run your tests using the editor of choice (e.g. Run tests in namspace in IntelliJ).

The tests are also set up to run with Kaocha at the command line for your convenience and CI tools:

```
$ clj -A:dev:clj-tests --watch
```

See the https://github.com/lambdaisland/kaocha[Kaocha project] for more details.

==== Clojurescript tests

The tests can be run in any number of browsers simply by navigating to the test URL that shadow-cljs outputs.

CI support is done through the `ci-test` build in shadow, and via Karma.

If you start the `ci-tests` build in Shadow-cljs, then you can also run cljs tests in a terminal "watch mode"
with:

```
npx karma start
```

Of course, this make CLJS CI easy:

```
npx shadow-cljs compile ci-tests
npx karma start --single-run
```

==== Running all Tests Once

There is a UNIX Makefile that includes all of the CI commands as the default target. Just run:

```
make
```

== Workspaces

NOT PORTED YET.

Workspaces is a project by Nubank that is written in Fulcro, and has great support for developing in
Fulcro. It is similar to devcards but has a more powerful user interface, integration with Fulcro Inspect,
and much more.

The source directory for making additions to your workspace is `src/workspaces`.

IMPORTANT: Any namespace ending in `-ws` will be auto-detected.

=== Workspaces and CSRF

TODO: Workspaces not ported yet.

The server comes preconfigured with CSRF protection.  As such, a token must be
embedded in the HTML for a client to be able to connect.  If you want to run
full-stack Fulcro cards, then you'll need that token.

The middleware included in this template can serve a workspaces HTML page that
has the correct token. The URI is `/wslive.html`. So, if your server is configured
for port 3000 you'd access your workspaces via `http://localhost:3000/wslive.html`.

Be careful with production deployment.  You may want to disable this HTML file and
make sure your workspaces js file isn't deployed to production.

== Standalone Runnable Jar (Production, with advanced optimized client js)

TODO: Use tools deps setup to build runnable jar...
